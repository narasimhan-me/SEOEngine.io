# Jira Epic: EA-43 — AUTOMATION-RUN-INTENT-CONFIRMATION-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** automation, hard-gate, phase-e, intent-confirmation, trust

---

## Summary

Introduce explicit, deliberate intent confirmation before any automation can run.

---

## Problem

Automation requires stronger intent signaling than manual actions.

---

## User Risk

Accidental or misunderstood automation execution.

---

## Intent

Introduce explicit, deliberate intent confirmation before any automation can run.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Clear pre-run confirmation step
- Explicit explanation of impact
- User acknowledgement of responsibility

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Auto-run
- One-click execution
- Silent confirmation

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- User must consciously confirm automation intent
- Impact is clearly restated before run
- No ambiguity about consequences

---

## Notes

🚨 HARD GATE — Phase E. No automation may run before this EA is complete.
