# Jira Epic: EA-38 — RETENTION-&-CONFIDENCE-REINFORCEMENT-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** retention, confidence, progress-reinforcement, trust

---

## Summary

Reinforce user confidence over time by reminding them what they've improved, what's safer now, and what value they've gained.

---

## Problem

Even after initial success, users may drift away if confidence is not reinforced.

---

## User Risk

Silent churn after first use.

---

## Intent

Reinforce user confidence over time by reminding them:

- what they've improved,
- what's safer now,
- what value they've gained.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Gentle progress reinforcement
- "What you've improved" summaries
- Confidence-building language

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Email campaigns
- Push notifications
- Aggressive re-engagement tactics

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users feel progress, not pressure
- Reinforcement is factual and calm
- No implied automation or authority

---

## Notes

In-product, calm reinforcement only; no email/push.
