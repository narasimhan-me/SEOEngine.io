**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** education, guidance, contextual-help, trust

---

## Summary

Provide lightweight, contextual education inside the product — exactly where questions arise.

---

## Problem

Users sometimes need help understanding why an issue matters or what a fix accomplishes.

---

## User Risk

Users either ignore issues or blindly apply fixes without confidence.

---

## Intent

Provide lightweight, contextual education inside the product — exactly where questions arise.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Contextual explanations
- Inline "learn more" guidance
- Educational framing without modal overload

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Long-form tutorials
- SEO courses
- External documentation dependency

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can understand decisions without leaving the product
- Education never blocks action
- Guidance feels optional, not mandatory

---

## Notes

Contextual only; no mandatory tours or external docs.
