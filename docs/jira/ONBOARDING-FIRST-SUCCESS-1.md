# Jira Epic: EA-34 — ONBOARDING-FIRST-SUCCESS-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** onboarding, activation, first-win, trust

---

## Summary

Guide first-time users to a small, safe, confidence-building success within their first session.

---

## Problem

New users can reach the product, but may not reach a clear first win quickly enough to feel value.

---

## User Risk

Users churn because they don't know:

- where to start,
- what "success" looks like,
- or whether they did the right thing.

---

## Intent

Guide first-time users to a small, safe, confidence-building success within their first session.

---

## Scope (IN)

- First-time user onboarding flow
- Clear "start here" guidance
- Explicit definition of first success (e.g., review + draft one fix)

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Tutorials longer than one session
- Automation
- Forced walkthroughs
- Pop-up heavy tours

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- A first-time user can complete one meaningful action within 10 minutes
- Onboarding never blocks exploration
- Users understand what "good progress" means

---

## Notes

First-win focus; keep flow short and optional.
