# Jira Epic: SAFETY-SIGNALING-&-CONFIDENCE-REINFORCEMENT-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** safety-signaling, copy-only, trust, no-rollback

---

## Summary

Safety signaling & confidence reinforcement — make existing safety guarantees more visible and reassuring without promising new capabilities. (NEW, COPY-ONLY)

---

## Important

This EA does NOT add rollback or undo.

---

## Problem

Users fear breaking live content even when the system is behaving safely.

---

## User Risk

Hesitation to apply fixes despite trust-safe mechanics already in place.

---

## Intent

Make existing safety guarantees more visible and reassuring without promising new capabilities.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Visual + copy reinforcement of:
  - Draft-first workflow
  - Explicit approval before apply
  - No automatic live changes
- Strategic placement of safety reassurance near Apply-related moments

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Rollback
- Undo
- Restore
- Version history
- "One-click revert" promises

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users clearly understand that nothing changes live without approval
- No UI copy implies reversibility unless it truly exists
- Safety language feels calm, not defensive

---

## Notes

📌 ClawdBot origin: "Make safety and reversibility explicit" (interpreted safely)
