# Jira Story: EA-54 — GLOBAL-TOP-NAV-VISUAL-DESIGN-POLISH-1

**Type:** Story  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** navigation, top-nav, visual-design, trust, polish

---

## Summary

Redesign Top Nav to feel calm, premium, and intentional — without changing product capabilities.

---

## Problem

Top Nav exists but doesn't feel designed; it increases cognitive load and makes the app feel unfinished.

---

## User Risk

Users hesitate because the product feels "tool-like" instead of "trusted," especially around governance flows.

---

## Intent

Redesign Top Nav to feel calm, premium, and intentional — without changing product capabilities.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Stronger visual hierarchy between:
  - brand / workspace
  - primary navigation
  - control-plane utilities (search, notifications, tenant, user)
- Clear, consistent active state that is unmissable
- Nav density reduction through grouping (not adding new items)
- "Coming soon" treatment that reduces noise (not "shouty")
- Consistent spacing, type scale, hover/pressed states

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- New routes
- New features
- New nav items
- Any automation behavior

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- First-time user can identify current area within 2 seconds
- Nav feels visually calm and not crowded at common viewport widths
- Utilities don't compete with primary navigation
- "Coming soon" does not look like a normal clickable destination
- No regression in trust UX: nav never implies execution power

---

## Notes

Recommended execution order: 1 (EA-54 first — make it look designed + calm).
