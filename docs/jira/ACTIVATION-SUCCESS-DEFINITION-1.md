# Jira Story: EA-51 — ACTIVATION-SUCCESS-DEFINITION-1

**Type:** Story  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** activation, confidence, success-definition, trust

---

## Summary

Define and surface what success looks like in EngineO.ai, especially for first-time users and early repeat sessions.

---

## Epic Type

Activation & Confidence Formation

---

## Problem (Observed Reality)

Users can:

- detect issues
- review drafts
- apply fixes
- explore playbooks

…but the product never clearly tells them:

"You've done the right thing. You are now in a safe, healthy state."

Success is implicit, not explicit.

---

## User Risk

- Users stop early, unsure if they're "done"
- Users over-fix because they think more is required
- Users churn quietly after first interaction

This is not a feature gap — it's a meaning gap.

---

## Intent (Authoritative)

Define and surface what success looks like in EngineO.ai, especially for:

- first-time users
- early repeat sessions

Success must feel:

- factual
- reassuring
- non-gamified
- non-salesy

---

## Scope (IN)

- Define "first safe success" (e.g. completed one review → draft → apply loop)
- Define "ongoing healthy usage" (e.g. drafts pending, no blocked states)
- Light-touch acknowledgement of progress:
  - language, not scores
  - summaries, not badges
- Make success visible without interrupting flow

---

## Explicitly OUT of Scope

- Gamification
- Points, scores, streaks
- Achievement badges
- Pressure language ("you should fix more")
- Upgrade prompts

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new user can tell when they've completed a successful first loop
- Success language reinforces confidence, not urgency
- Users do not feel pushed to keep fixing unnecessarily
- Success framing does not change system behavior

---

## Definition of Done (UEP)

A user can answer: "Am I in a good state right now?" — without guessing.
