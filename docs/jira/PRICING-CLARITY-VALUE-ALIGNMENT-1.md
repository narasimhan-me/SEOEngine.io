# Jira Epic: EA-35 — PRICING-CLARITY-&-VALUE-ALIGNMENT-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** pricing, trust, copy, value-narrative

---

## Summary

Make pricing simple, honest, and aligned to real user value, not feature lists.

---

## Problem

Users may not clearly understand:

- what they are paying for,
- which plan fits them,
- or when they should upgrade.

---

## User Risk

Pricing confusion erodes trust and delays conversion.

---

## Intent

Make pricing simple, honest, and aligned to real user value, not feature lists.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Clear value narrative per plan
- Plain-English plan differentiation
- Explicit "who this plan is for" framing
- Alignment between in-product limits and pricing copy

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- New pricing tiers
- Discount logic
- Billing system changes

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can explain plan differences without reading fine print
- No plan implies hidden power
- Upgrade paths feel natural, not pressured

---

## Notes

Value-first framing; no new billing or tiers.
