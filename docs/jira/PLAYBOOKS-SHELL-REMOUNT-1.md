# Jira Epic: EA-40 — PLAYBOOKS-SHELL-REMOUNT-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** playbooks, phase-e, read-only, trust

---

## Summary

Introduce a Playbooks shell that organizes fix strategies without executing anything.

---

## Problem

Users see issues but lack a structured way to understand repeatable fix strategies across their store.

---

## User Risk

Users fix issues one-by-one without understanding broader patterns or consistency.

---

## Intent

Introduce a Playbooks shell that organizes fix strategies without executing anything.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Playbooks navigation shell
- Read-only visibility into available playbooks
- Clear explanation of what a playbook represents

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Execution
- Automation
- Scheduling
- Auto-apply

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can browse playbooks safely
- No playbook implies automatic execution
- Playbooks feel educational, not powerful

---

## Notes

Phase E — Playbooks & Guidance (Post-Trust). Shell only; no execution.
