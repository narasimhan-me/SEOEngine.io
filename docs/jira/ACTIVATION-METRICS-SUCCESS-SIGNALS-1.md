# Jira Epic: EA-37 — ACTIVATION-METRICS-&-SUCCESS-SIGNALS-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** activation, metrics, product-insight, internal-only

---

## Summary

Define and surface activation and success signals that reflect real user progress.

---

## Problem

The system lacks a clear definition of:

- what "activated" means,
- whether a user is succeeding,
- or when intervention is needed.

---

## User Risk

You can't improve activation if you can't observe it.

---

## Intent

Define and surface activation and success signals that reflect real user progress.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Definition of activation milestones
- Success indicators aligned to user value
- Internal metrics for product insight

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Vanity metrics
- User-facing scores
- Gamification

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Team can identify where users stall
- Metrics reflect user outcomes, not activity
- Signals do not pressure or shame users

---

## Notes

Internal use only; no user-facing scores or gamification.
