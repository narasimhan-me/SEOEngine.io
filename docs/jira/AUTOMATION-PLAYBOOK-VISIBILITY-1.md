# Jira Epic: EA-42 — AUTOMATION-PLAYBOOK-VISIBILITY-1

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** automation, playbooks, phase-e, visibility-only, trust

---

## Summary

Expose automation playbooks as concepts only, not actions.

---

## Problem

Users don't know what automation could do without fearing loss of control.

---

## User Risk

Automation feels opaque or dangerous.

---

## Intent

Expose automation playbooks as concepts only, not actions.

---

## Scope (IN)

- Visibility into automation-capable playbooks
- Clear "what would happen if run" explanations
- Scope boundaries (what it touches / doesn't touch)

---

## Explicitly OUT of scope (HARD LINE)

- Running automation
- Scheduling
- Background execution

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users understand automation scope without fear
- Automation is framed as optional and controlled
- No execution affordance exists

---

## Notes

Phase E. Concepts only; no run/schedule/execute.
