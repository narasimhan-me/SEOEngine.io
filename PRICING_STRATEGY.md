# EngineO.ai — Pricing Strategy & Revenue Model

**Version 1.0** — December 2025  
**Author:** Narasimhan Mahendrakumar

---

## 1. Overview

EngineO.ai is an AI-first Discovery Engine Optimization (DEO) platform that combines:

- SEO automation
- AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
- PEO (Product Engine Optimization)
- VEO (Voice Engine Optimization)
- Entity intelligence
- Answer-ready content
- Multi-engine visibility
- Shopify + web integrations
- Bulk content/product optimization
- Automated DEO playbooks

This stack positions EngineO.ai closer to tools like Surfer, Clearscope, Frase, Ahrefs, DeepCrawl, Perplexity for Business, and AI content orchestration tools — but with automation as a core advantage.

The pricing strategy must reflect:

- High-value automation
- AI token variable costs
- Multi-project agency usage
- eCommerce scaling (product-heavy stores)
- AI assistant + search visibility monitoring
- Professional services potential
- Long-term enterprise workflow integrations

This document defines Launch Pricing, Scale Pricing, and Enterprise Pricing, including token strategy, feature gating, and upgrade paths.

## 2. Pricing Goals

The pricing model must:

1. **Maximize early adoption**
   - Low-friction entry → rapid user acquisition.

2. **Capture value over time**
   - DEO is radically more valuable than "AI SEO tools".
   - As automation + intelligence scale, prices should rise accordingly.

3. **Encourage expansion (land & expand)**
   - Multi-project teams and agencies should grow naturally into higher tiers.

4. **Monetize automation + compute**
   - DEO audits and bulk generation consume compute + AI tokens. Pricing must scale with usage.

5. **Maintain competitive clarity**
   - Offer simple, predictable tiers while supporting advanced capabilities.

---

## 3. Pricing Philosophy

EngineO.ai uses a hybrid value model:

- Subscription-based tiers
- AI token allotments per tier
- Feature gating
- Project and product/page limits
- Automation depth
- Reporting & team access

This aligns with how modern AI SaaS tools scale (e.g., Jasper, Frase, Surfer) while also matching eCommerce/agency usage patterns.

---

## 4. Launch Pricing (Months 0–6)

These prices optimize for market penetration and rapid validation.

### ⭐ Starter — $19 / month

For new brands, creators, early stores.

- 3 projects
- 500 products/pages
- 200k AI tokens
- DEO audit & visibility score
- AI metadata + answer suggestions
- Basic DEO automations
- Shopify + site integration

### ⭐ Pro — $59 / month

For growing brands.

- 10 projects
- 5,000 products/pages
- 2M AI tokens
- Smart schema & entity markup
- AI content generator
- Competitor insights
- Redirect manager

### ⭐ Agency — $199 / month

For agencies and large teams.

- Unlimited projects
- Unlimited products/pages
- 10M AI tokens

- Priority support

### Why Launch Pricing is lower

- Reduce barrier to adoption
- Seed DEO category in market
- Build dataset for DEO score
- Gather entity graphs at scale
- Allow smaller stores to onboard easily
- Position EngineO as the first-mover in DEO

### DEO Guarantees Across All Tiers

All launch tiers include, at minimum:

- DEO Score visibility for each project
- Entity intelligence signals (depth increases by tier)
- Answer-ready content capabilities
- Multi-engine visibility tracking (starting with SEO surfaces, expanding into AEO/PEO/VEO)

---

## 5. Scale Pricing (Months 6–18)

After DEO Score, Entity Intelligence, Multi-engine Visibility, and Automation Playbooks mature, pricing should increase.

- 🌱 Starter — $29
- 🚀 Pro — $79
- 🏢 Agency — $249

### New tier added:

### ⭐ Business / Team — $149

For companies that outgrow Pro but don't want Agency.

Adds:

- 20 projects
- 15M tokens
- Advanced reporting
- Team roles
- Multi-store integrations
- API access (read-only)

### Rationale

- DEO value is clearer by this phase
- Automation reduces human workload
- Entity intelligence is a premium value-add
- Competitive tools charge $79–$149 for LESS

---

## 6. Enterprise Pricing (Months 18+)

Once AI assistant visibility, multi-engine metrics, and advanced entity graphs mature:

### 🏢 Enterprise — $399–$799+/month

Include:

- Unlimited projects
- Unlimited teams
- 30M–100M tokens
- Dedicated DEO strategist
- Custom entity graphs
- Multi-brand dashboards
- SSO & SCIM
- Full API access
- On-prem or private cloud (optional)
- Guaranteed SLAs
- Quarterly strategy planning

Enterprise pricing reflects:

- DEO as foundational infrastructure
- AI assistant visibility as mission-critical
- Deep automations saving thousands of human hours
- Multi-store multi-country operations

## 7. Add-ons & Usage-Based Revenue

## 11. Pricing Experiments (A/B Tests)

1. **Starter → remove token limits?**
   - Pros: viral growth, fewer complaints
   - Cons: unpredictable cost
   - Decision: keep token limit.

2. **Pro → $79 vs $59**
   - Run A/B test once DEO Score is live.

3. **Agency → $199 vs $249**
   - Increase once priority support + team features mature.

4. **Optional annual discount**
   - 20% annual → standard SaaS practice.

---

## 12. Summary

- Launch pricing is intentionally lower to maximize adoption.
- Scale pricing should rise to reflect DEO value (6–18 months).
- Enterprise pricing becomes feasible when EngineO.ai becomes critical infrastructure.
- Pricing scales with AI token consumption, automation depth, and multi-engine visibility.
- EngineO should aggressively capture early users while DEO is still new and undisrupted.

## 13. Next Steps

If approved, the next steps are:

1. Insert the DEO-aligned plans array into the pricing page.
2. Add this file to `/docs/PRICING_STRATEGY.md`.
3. In 1–2 phases, implement the "Pro vs Agency gating logic" in API + app.
4. Add token-balancing + usage logging (for future billing).
5. Implement annual billing toggle in the UI.
6. Prepare for future "Business" tier.

### DEO Compute Pools

Each plan receives a monthly DEO Compute Pool that covers:

- Entity extraction
