## Summary

**KAN-16: AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ALLOWED-FILES-BULLET-PARSER-FIXUP-1 - Status: COMPLETE**

The implementation requested in KAN-16 has already been completed in previous commits. Here's what I found:

### Implementation Status ✓

**Parser Code** (scripts/autonomous-agent/engine.py:297):
- The `_parse_allowed_files()` function already includes Unicode bullet support
- Line 297: `cleaned = stripped.lstrip('-*•').strip()`
- Recognizes bullets: `-`, `*`, and `•` (Unicode U+2022)

**Test Coverage** (scripts/autonomous-agent/tests/test_allowed_files_parser.py):
- 9 comprehensive test cases covering all bullet types
- All tests passing (9/9)
- Includes specific test for Unicode bullets: `test_unicode_bullets()`

**Verification Report** (reports/AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ALLOWED-FILES-BULLET-PARSER-FIXUP-1-verification.md):
- Complete checklist confirming all acceptance criteria met
- Documents the minimal change (1 character addition)
- Within DIFF BUDGET (5 lines)

### Acceptance Criteria - All Met ✓

- ✓ Parses `-` bullets
- ✓ Parses `*` bullets  
- ✓ Parses `•` bullets (Unicode from Jira)
- ✓ Works with Jira rich-text rendering
- ✓ Existing behavior unchanged
- ✓ No backend/product code changes
- ✓ Unit tests added and passing
- ✓ Guardrails no longer block valid Jira tickets
