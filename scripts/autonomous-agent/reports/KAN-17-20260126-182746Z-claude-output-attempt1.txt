## Summary

The KAN-17 implementation is **already complete and committed** to the feature/agent branch. Here's what I found:

### Implementation Status
✅ **Already Implemented** in commit `326d91f` (Jan 26, 2026)

### Key Components
1. **resolve_dispatch_kind() function** (engine.py:2828-2845)
   - Routes both 'story' and 'bug' to 'implement' dispatch kind
   - Normalizes input (lowercase, strip whitespace)
   - Returns appropriate dispatch kind for routing

2. **Unit Tests** (scripts/autonomous-agent/tests/test_issue_dispatch.py)
   - 8 comprehensive test cases
   - All tests passing ✅
   - Covers Bug, Story, Epic, Idea, and edge cases

3. **Verification Report** (scripts/autonomous-agent/reports/KAN-17-verification.md)
   - Complete with required "## Checklist"
   - Relocated in commit `07d5710`

============================== 8 passed in 0.19s
```

### Acceptance Criteria Status
✅ `./run.sh --issue <BUG>` executes the implementation pipeline (no "unknown type")  
✅ Bug execution via `--issue` matches queue mode behavior  
✅ Stories/Epics/Ideas behavior unchanged  
✅ Unit test added for issue-type dispatch (story + bug)

The implementation is production-ready and fully tested. No new commit is needed as the work was already completed in previous commits.
