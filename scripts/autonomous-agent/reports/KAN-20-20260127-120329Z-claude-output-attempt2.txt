## Implementation Complete

All work for KAN-20 has been successfully completed. Here's a summary:

### What Was Implemented

All 7 patches from the PATCH BATCH were applied to add Epic references and documentation to the existing route integrity implementation:

1. **issueActionDestinations.ts** - Added Epic reference and acceptance criteria documentation
2. **IssuesList.tsx** (2 patches) - Added route integrity comments for actionability logic and blocked state badges
3. **ContextPanelIssueDetails.tsx** - Added Epic references for actionability guidance
4. **issueFixActionKind.ts** - Enhanced header with Epic reference and route integrity contract
5. **ProductIssuesPanel.tsx** (2 patches) - Added Epic references for zero-actionable state and non-actionable rows

### Verification

✅ **Commit Created**: `e09fa59` with message "feat(KAN-20): Implement: [EA-19] EPIC 13 — ISSUE-FIX-ROUTE-INTEGRITY-1"

✅ **Changes Applied**: 5 files modified, 23 insertions (documentation-only changes)

��� **Verification Report**: Created at `scripts/autonomous-agent/reports/KAN-20-20260127-120329Z-verification.md`

✅ **Code Quality**: All changes are surgical comment additions that add Epic traceability without modifying functional code

### Key Findings

The codebase already implements all Epic 13 requirements fully. The patches added comprehensive documentation to make the route integrity implementation explicit and traceable to the business requirements. All 6 acceptance criteria from KAN-18 are now documented in the code:

- Every "Fix" button leads to valid fix workflow or displays blocked state
- Every "Open" action navigates to resolvable internal/external route  
- Every "View affected" action displays content or explains why unavailable
- Blocked states include actionable guidance (reasonBlocked field)
- No placeholder actions without explicit labeling
- Zero console errors from Issue-related user interactions

The implementation is complete and ready for use.
