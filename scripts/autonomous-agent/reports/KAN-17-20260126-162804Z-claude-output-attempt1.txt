## Summary

I have completed the investigation of KAN-17. Here's what I found:

### Current State

The **KAN-17 implementation is already complete** and has been committed to the repository:

1. **Bug Dispatch Feature** - Implemented in commit `326d91f`:
   - The `resolve_dispatch_kind()` function in `engine.py:2564-2581` correctly maps both 'story' and 'bug' to 'implement'
   - Bugs are routed through the same `_process_story()` pipeline as Stories
   - Full guardrails, verification gates, and transitions apply to Bugs

2. **Unit Tests** - Added in commit `326d91f`:
   - File: `scripts/autonomous-agent/tests/test_issue_dispatch.py`
   - 8 comprehensive test cases covering Story, Bug, Epic, Idea dispatch
   - All tests pass successfully

3. **Verification Report** - Created in commit `6060157`:
   - File: `reports/KAN-17-verification.md`
   - Comprehensive documentation with required "## Checklist" section
   - Confirms all acceptance criteria met

### Test Results

All 8 unit tests pass:
- ✅ `test_bug_returns_implement` - Bug → implement
- ✅ `test_bug_lowercase_returns_implement` - bug → implement  
- ✅ `test_story_returns_implement` - Story → implement
- ✅ All other issue type tests pass

### Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| ./run.sh --issue <BUG> executes implementation pipeline | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Bug execution matches queue mode behavior | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Stories/Epics/Ideas behavior unchanged | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Unit test added for issue-type dispatch | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Verification report with checklist | ✅ COMPLETE |

### Constraints Compliance

- ✅ SCOPE CLASS: AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ONLY - All changes in `scripts/autonomous-agent/**`
- ✅ ALLOWED FILES: Only modified `scripts/autonomous-agent/**`
- ✅ DIFF BUDGET: Minimal changes (within 5 files)
- ✅ VERIFICATION REQUIRED: `reports/KAN-17-verification.md` exists with checklist

The implementation was previously completed and is production-ready. No new commits are needed as the work has already been committed under previous commit messages.
