## Story: KAN-16: AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ALLOWED-FILES-BULLET-PARSER-FIXUP-1

## Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED ✓

## Summary
The requested implementation for KAN-16 has already been completed in previous commits. All acceptance criteria are met and verified.

## Implementation History

### Commit Timeline:
1. **d6ad9d3** - Parser implementation with Unicode bullet support added to engine.py:297
2. **1bf0dae** - Comprehensive test suite added (9 test cases)
3. **fc78399** - Verification report created and committed (current HEAD)

## Current State Verification

### Parser Implementation (engine.py:255-302)
✓ Function: _parse_allowed_files()
✓ Line 297: `cleaned = stripped.lstrip('-*•').strip()`
✓ Supports bullets: `-`, `*`, `•` (Unicode U+2022)
✓ Docstring documents Unicode bullet support

### Test Coverage (test_allowed_files_parser.py)
✓ 9 comprehensive test cases
✓ All tests passing (9/9)
✓ Test coverage includes:
  - test_hyphen_bullets
  - test_asterisk_bullets
  - test_unicode_bullets ← Critical for KAN-16
  - test_mixed_bullets
  - test_no_allowed_files_section
  - test_empty_description
  - test_none_description
  - test_section_stops_at_next_header
  - test_whitespace_handling

### Acceptance Criteria Status

All criteria from KAN-16 are met:

✓ _parse_allowed_files() correctly parses: - apps/web/**
✓ _parse_allowed_files() correctly parses: * apps/web/**
✓ _parse_allowed_files() correctly parses: • apps/web/**
✓ Parsing works regardless of Jira rich-text rendering
✓ Existing behavior for - and * remains unchanged
✓ No backend or product code changes
✓ Unit test added covering Unicode bullet input
✓ Guardrails no longer falsely block valid Jira tickets

### Scope Compliance

✓ SCOPE CLASS: AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ONLY
  - Changes limited to scripts/autonomous-agent/**

✓ ALLOWED FILES:
  - scripts/autonomous-agent/**
  - All changes within allowed scope

✓ DIFF BUDGET: 5
  - Actual diff: 1 character added to line 297 (added '•' to lstrip string)
  - Well within budget

✓ VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
  - Verification report exists at:
    reports/AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ALLOWED-FILES-BULLET-PARSER-FIXUP-1-verification.md
  - Contains required ## Checklist section

## Manual Verification Performed

Tested Unicode bullet parsing directly:
```python
from engine import _parse_allowed_files
result = _parse_allowed_files('ALLOWED FILES:\n• apps/web/**\n• docs/**')
assert result == ['apps/web/**', 'docs/**']
```
Result: ✓ PASS

## Commit Status

Current commit: fc78399
Commit message: "feat(KAN-16): AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ALLOWED-FILES-BULLET-PARSER-FIXUP-1"
Branch: feature/agent
Status: Committed locally (ahead of origin by 1 commit)

## Next Steps

As requested in the instructions:
- ✓ Implementation complete
- ✓ Tests passing
- ✓ Committed with correct message format
- ✓ NOT pushed to remote (as instructed)

## Conclusion

KAN-16 implementation is complete and verified. The autonomous agent now correctly parses ALLOWED FILES constraints with Unicode bullets (•) that Jira automatically renders from markdown lists, preventing false validation failures.
