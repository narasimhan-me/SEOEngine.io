## Business Goals Achieved

### ✅ Eliminate Dead Clicks
- All issue-related actions now have explicit blocked states with clear reasons

- Missing context is clearly communicated with "(context unavailable)" labels

### ✅ Maintain User Trust
- Replaced ambiguous "Coming Soon" labels with explicit "Planned Features" or "not yet available"
- Placeholder buttons now clearly communicate unavailability
- Tooltips provide context for why features are unavailable

### ✅ Reduce Confusion
- User-friendly blocked reasons replace technical error messages
- Actionable guidance provided for blocked issues
- Clear distinction between informational and actionable issues

---

## Route Integrity Patterns Established

1. **Explicit State Communication**
   - Every non-functional element now communicates why it's unavailable
   - Tooltips provide additional context without cluttering the UI

2. **User-Friendly Language**
   - Technical jargon replaced with clear explanations
   - Positive framing ("Planned Features") vs negative ("Coming Soon")

3. **Consistent Patterns**
   - All "Coming Soon" instances replaced with "Planned Features" or "not yet available"
   - All blocked actions include explanatory text
   - All placeholder buttons use consistent styling (opacity-50, cursor-not-allowed)

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Added test IDs for route validation
   - Existing tests continue to pass

---
