Perfect! Let me create a summary of findings:

## Summary

I have completed the investigation of KAN-17. Here are my findings:

### Implementation Status: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE

The bug dispatch functionality described in KAN-17 was **already fully implemented** in previous commits:

1. **Commit 326d91f** (2026-01-26): "feat(autonomous-agent): Bug dispatch support + security hardening"
   - Added `resolve_dispatch_kind()` function that routes Bugs to 'implement' dispatch kind
   - Routes Bugs through the same `_process_story()` pipeline as Stories
   - Added `--type bug` option to argparse
   - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_issue_dispatch.py`

2. **Commit 6060157**: Added the verification report at `reports/KAN-17-verification.md`

### Current State

✅ **Bug Dispatch Logic** (`engine.py:2542`):
```python
if normalized in ('story', 'bug'):
    return 'implement'
```

✅ **Main Dispatch Handler** (`engine.py:2111-2113`):
```python
elif dispatch_kind == 'implement':
    # Developer implements Stories and Bugs (same pipeline)
    return self._process_story(issue)
```

✅ **Unit Tests**: All 8 tests pass successfully
```
$ python3 tests/test_issue_dispatch.py
........
Ran 8 tests in 0.000s
OK
```

✅ **Verification Report**: Already exists at `reports/KAN-17-verification.md` with required checklist

### Acceptance Criteria Status

All acceptance criteria are met:
- ✅ `./run.sh --issue <BUG>` executes the implementation pipeline (no "unknown type" error)
- ✅ Bug execution via --issue matches queue mode behavior
- ✅ Stories/Epics/Ideas behavior unchanged  
- ✅ Unit tests added for issue-type dispatch

### Constraints Compliance

- ✅ SCOPE CLASS: AUTONOMOUS-AGENT-ONLY (all changes in `scripts/autonomous-agent/**`)
- ✅ ALLOWED FILES: `scripts/autonomous-agent/**`
- ✅ DIFF BUDGET: 5 (minimal changes, already committed)
- ✅ VERIFICATION REQUIRED: `reports/KAN-17-verification.md` exists with checklist

### Conclusion

**No new commit is required.** The functionality was already implemented and committed in previous work sessions. The codebase is already in the correct state with:
- Bug dispatch working correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Complete verification documentation

All requirements of KAN-17 have been satisfied.
