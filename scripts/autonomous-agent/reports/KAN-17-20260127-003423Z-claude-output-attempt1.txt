=== Attempt 1/3 ===
This is an escalations log file. It's not part of KAN-17 implementation. Based on the recent commits, it seems this file was moved to `.engineo/` directory in a recent commit.

Now let me verify the complete implementation one more time by checking all the key components:

## Summary

The KAN-17 implementation is **already complete**:

1. **Code Implementation** ✅
   - `resolve_dispatch_kind()` function correctly maps 'bug' → 'implement' (engine.py:3003)
   - `process_issue()` routes 'implement' dispatch kind to `_process_story()` (engine.py:2563-2565)
   - Comment explicitly states "Developer implements Stories and Bugs (same pipeline)"

2. **Unit Tests** ✅
   - `tests/test_issue_dispatch.py` contains 8 comprehensive tests
   - Tests cover Bug dispatch for both 'Bug' and 'bug' (case-insensitive)
   - All 8 tests passing

3. **Verification Report** ✅
   - `scripts/autonomous-agent/reports/KAN-17-verification.md` exists
   - Contains required "## Checklist" section
   - Documents all acceptance criteria as met

4. **Git History** ✅
   - Initial implementation in commit 326d91f (Jan 26 07:46)
   - KAN-17 commits: 00473ab (Jan 26 10:32) and 41a6e6f (Jan 26 12:31)
   - Verification report committed in 07d5710 (Jan 26 11:24)

Since everything is already implemented and committed, and there are no uncommitted changes related to KAN-17, the task is complete. The instruction to commit was likely referring to the initial implementation, which has already been done.

**Conclusion**: KAN-17 is fully implemented, tested, verified, and committed. No further action is required.
