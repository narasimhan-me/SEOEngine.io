# EngineO.ai — Messaging Foundations

## Personas

### Primary: Shopify & eCommerce Operator

- Runs a DTC or eCommerce brand (often on Shopify, 50–5,000 products)
- Knows visibility in search and AI assistants matters but doesn't have time to master SEO or AEO
- Wears multiple hats — marketing, ops, product, customer support
- Frustrated by expensive agencies and confusing, SEO-only tools

### Secondary: SEO / Growth Lead or Agency

- Manages organic growth for multiple brands or clients
- Needs scalable workflows to handle audits, content, products, and reporting across sites
- Values automation that frees time for strategy and communication
- Looking for a platform that goes beyond traditional SEO into AI-era discovery

---

## Positioning

EngineO.ai is the AI-first Discovery Engine Optimization (DEO) platform that helps brands and agencies optimize their entire presence across search engines and AI assistants — including SEO, AEO, PEO, and VEO — without hiring a large team or relying solely on agencies.

## Key Value Props

- **Multi-engine optimization, one platform** — Unifies SEO, AEO, PEO, and VEO signals so you can see, fix, and improve everything that drives discoverability.
- **AI-generated metadata & content** — Titles, descriptions, alt text, FAQs, and answer-ready snippets generated in seconds, aligned to your brand.
- **One-click store and site sync** — Pull products, pages, and collections; push optimized content back to Shopify and your site.
- **Automated discovery audits** — Catch broken links, missing tags, weak entities, and answer gaps before they hurt visibility in search and AI surfaces.
- **Bulk product & content optimization** — Fix hundreds of products or pages at once instead of one-by-one.
- **DEO Score & visibility insights** — Track how discoverable your brand is across engines and surfaces from a single dashboard.
